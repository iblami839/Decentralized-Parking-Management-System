# Decentralized Parking Management System

A blockchain-based platform for efficient, transparent, and user-friendly urban parking management.

## Overview

This decentralized application leverages blockchain technology to transform urban parking management by creating a seamless, transparent system that benefits drivers, parking space owners, and city administrators. By digitizing the entire parking process from space registration to violation management, the system reduces congestion, increases space utilization, and improves overall urban mobility.

## System Components

### 1. Space Registration Contract

This smart contract creates a digital registry of all available parking spaces with their specific details and availability.

**Key Features:**
- Digital twin of parking infrastructure with unique identifiers
- Detailed space attributes (size, clearance height, accessibility features)
- Ownership verification and management
- Dynamic availability status updates
- Pricing configuration options (hourly, daily, subscription)
- Special designation support (electric vehicle, disabled, loading zone)
- Integration with IoT sensors for real-time occupancy detection
- Geolocation and mapping capabilities
- Photo and additional information storage
- Public vs. private space designation

### 2. Reservation Contract

This contract enables drivers to find and book parking spaces in advance, ensuring availability upon arrival.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time availability search functionality
- Advance booking with duration specification
- Reservation confirmation and digital receipt
- Calendar integration for recurring reservations
- Flexible booking modification and cancellation policies
- Wait-listing for high-demand locations
- User profile and vehicle information storage
- Special needs accommodation (accessibility requirements)
- Reservation history and preferred space saving
- QR code or token generation for access verification
- Integration with navigation systems

### 3. Payment Processing Contract

This contract manages the financial transactions associated with parking usage in a secure, transparent manner.

**Key Features:**
- Automated fee calculation based on actual usage time
- Multiple payment method support (cryptocurrency, credit card, mobile payment)
- Micro-payment capabilities for minute-by-minute billing
- Secure escrow for reservation deposits
- Subscription and loyalty program management
- Dynamic pricing based on demand and time of day
- Revenue distribution to space owners and system operators
- Automated receipt generation for expense reporting
- Tax calculation and reporting
- Refund processing for cancellations or service issues
- Integration with corporate expense systems

### 4. Violation Reporting Contract

This contract creates a transparent system for identifying, reporting, and managing parking violations.

**Key Features:**
- Mobile app-based violation reporting with photo evidence
- Verification mechanism to prevent false reports
- Automated fine calculation and notification
- Appeal process management
- Payment tracking for violations
- Integration with enforcement authorities
- Repeat offender identification
- Statistical analysis of violation patterns
- Community-based enforcement incentives
- Automated license plate recognition integration
- Warning system for first-time or minor violations

## Technical Implementation
